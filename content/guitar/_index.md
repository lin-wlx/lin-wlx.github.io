Apart from my academic work, I very much enjoy music (all sorts). Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the privilege to study from [Mike Outram](https://www.mikeoutram.com/) and play in a few bands & projects. For instance this one named [Ab Initio Music](https://www.instagram.com/ab.initio.music?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MXBhNm5icXZrN2o4Mg==) has an Instagram page.

You can also find some of my playing [here](https://www.instagram.com/guitarguitarlin?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=OGp5bjlxbmNjMXdl) and [here](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/6163be60000000000201c919?xsec_token=YBMeOqZiAKXDLzSbLAMXJzQHHmR6PY208Ze8XMmZADL9U=&xsec_source=app_share&xhsshare=CopyLink&appuid=6163be60000000000201c919&apptime=1749672200&share_id=4083ca64cdb5428b8493f1f56afb64be).

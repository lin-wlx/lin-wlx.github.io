# Research Experience

**Polynomial-Time Approximation of Minimum Spanning Trees: Time Complexity of Simulated Annealing and Metropolis–Hastings Algorithm**  
*LSE BSc Dissertation in Mathematics, Sep 2024 - May 2025*  
- Research focused on performances of probabilistic random search algorithms Simulated Annealing (SA) and Metropolis Algorithm (MA) for solving the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem in combinatorial optimisation
- Provided full proof that:
  - MA is unsuccessful on certain MST instances for arbitrary fixed temperature
  - SA with a geometric cooling schedule solves these instances in polynomial time with high probability
- Provided explicit probabilistic bounds on success probabilities of SA and MA
- Contributed detailed derivations and proofs of the key theorems and lemmas underlying both Wegener (2005) and Doerr et al. (2022)

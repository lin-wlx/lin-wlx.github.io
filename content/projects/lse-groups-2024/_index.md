In this LSE GROUPS 2024 project, we investigated the effect of US-imposed tariffs and Chinese retaliatory tariffs on the favourability of Donald Trump. To estimate the causal effect of cost-of-living increases due to tariffs on voter sentiment, I proposed IV and Differences-in-Differences (DiD) econometric model. The analysis is then done on ANES survey data using STATA.

We presented findings at the LSE GROUPS student research conference on the very last day, and were awarded *Most Impressive Methodological Rigor*. That was a blast!

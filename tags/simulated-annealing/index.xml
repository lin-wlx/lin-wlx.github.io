The Metropolis Algorithm is one of the earliest and most fundamental Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The algorithm can be adapted to search for optimal solutions in a combinatorial optimisation problem, with a fixed parameter (temperature) to control for acceptance probabilities. Simulated annealing is Metropolis with a varied temperature.
In this dissertation, I gave an overview of two papers: one by Wegener(2005), covering how the Metropolis algorithm with arbitrary fixed temperature is unsuccessful on instances of the minimum spanning tree problem, whereas Simulated Annealing with a geometric cooling schedule is successful; the other by Doerr, Rajabi, and Witt (2022), covering that Simulated Annealing with an appropriate cooling schedule computes arbitrarily tight constant-factor approximations to the minimum spanning tree problem in polynomial time, which is a result conjectured by Wegener (2005).</description></item></channel></rss>
